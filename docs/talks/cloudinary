Cloudinary - File Upload (Jeff's lightning talk)

Doesn't seriazlie the image like amazon AWS - instead it gives you a direct URL to embed
you can keep it in assetts in Rails, but heroku can get bogged down by it.


Cloudinary widget - full-screen modal asking for upload

* Add script to application header HTML
* follow instructions - get API key, get upload preset from the site
* cloudinary.openUploadWidget({upload_preset: ..., cloud_name: ...})
  + goes in upload function of backbone view, triggered on click
   change to fnwidget(CLOUDINARY_SETTINGS, function(error, payload) {
   if (error)
     asdfasfd
    } else {
      asdfasdf
    });
   where CLOUDINARY_SETTINGS is an object you make (see below)
* Cloudinary allows you to transform images

Figaro
* do NOT put cloud name in javascript directly - users can pull it out!
* do not store API keys on github!!
* gem: figaro! creates config/application.yml, says do not upload that to github
* how do we push to heroku for production? 'figaro heroku' or some command (!)


* inside rails controller, value accessible by ENV["key"] (from application.yml)
* from inside application.html.erb: (ex.)
      window.cloud_name: <%= ENV['cloud_name'] %>
      (inside a <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">window.....</script>)
      or better, wrap in CLOUDINARY_SETTINGS object
* if user cancels, we have an error
* in view upload function, on success of save, upload to collection and boom!
